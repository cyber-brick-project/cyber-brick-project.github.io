Cyber Brick Project is mix of Lego, electronics and passion for creation.

Root idea was automating Lego Trains, however, after a time it started to grow. Also boosted by projects like
[AlmightyArjen.com](http://www.almightyarjen.com/){:target="_blank"}.

Real work was officially stared in May 2019, but some concepts are about 20 years old, and most of
needed engineering knowledge was built during studies and employment.

After some preparations, decision was made. This project should be something more than just
another attempt to connect Arduinos with Lego. Cyber Brick Project will be also a brief touch
of other skills than just soldering and coding. This venture will contain various documentations,
videos, descriptions and additional materials (like stickers for ATMega with pins description).

From time to time side works and activities can appear. Some of them are already planned, yet still waits
for their time. Such intermissions will be gathered in separate category on this website.
